# 👋 About Me — Janga Guru Praveen Reddy

🎓 **Mechanical Engineer** → 📊 **Aspiring Data Analyst**

## 👨‍🔧 My Background

I completed my B.Tech in Mechanical Engineering and began my career at **Sandhar Technologies**, where I worked for 1.5 years. During this time, I managed production data through **MIS (Management Information Systems)** — tracking metrics like cycle time, tool usage, efficiency, and planning.

It was this exposure to **real-time data**, **problem-solving**, and **optimizing processes using numbers** that sparked my passion for data analysis.

## 🔁 My Transition to Data Analytics

After working in a couple of roles that didn't align with my skillset or interests, I took a step back to reflect on what truly excites me — and that was **working with data**.

I then focused on upskilling in:
- **Python for data analysis**
- **SQL for querying structured data**
- **Power BI for business dashboards**
- **Excel for quick reporting and KPIs**
