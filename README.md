# 👋 About Me — Janga Guru Praveen Reddy

🎓 **Mechanical Engineer** → 📊 **Aspiring Data Analyst**

## 👨‍🔧 My Background

I completed my B.Tech in Mechanical Engineering and began my career at **Sandhar Technologies**, where I worked for 1.5 years. During this time, I was deeply involved in **MIS (Management Information Systems)**, where I tracked and analyzed production data — including **cycle time, tool performance, utilization, and manpower efficiency**.

This hands-on experience with **real-time production data** and solving on-the-ground problems sparked my interest in **data analytics**. I discovered how data could guide better decision-making, efficiency, and insight.

## 🔁 My Transition to Data Analytics

After gaining real-world experience, I realized my passion lies in solving problems with data. I took a focused approach to shift into data analytics by learning tools and skills such as:

- ✅ **Python** for data manipulation and automation
- ✅ **SQL** for database querying and data warehouse design
- ✅ **Power BI** for interactive dashboards and business reporting
- ✅ **Microsoft Excel** for fast-paced analysis and KPIs

Today, I’m actively applying these skills to real-world datasets and sharing my projects on GitHub.
